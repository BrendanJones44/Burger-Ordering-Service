To use react components:
1. Create a react component in this directory or subdirectory
2. In the views .html.erb file, insert the component as follows:
<%= react_component("React_Component_Name", {propName: "propValue"}) %>

Notes:
1. Since this is Rails v6, the <%= javascript_pack_tag 'application' %> is
not necessary in the .html.erb file.
